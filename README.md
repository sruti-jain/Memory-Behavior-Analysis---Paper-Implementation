# Memory-Behavior-Analysis---Paper-Implementation

Dataset Information: SAM, OSIQ, BFI
1.	The Survey of Autobiographical memory (SAM) was designed to access trait mnemonics of naturalistic episodic autobiographical, semantic, spatial memory & future thinking. It records the data taken from a sample of 153 people (rows) to measure mnemonic abilities using 31 variables. There are two nominal variables (Active, Sex) & one factor variable (MemoryGroup). The rest of the variables are all integer with two (ID & Age) being a ratio-scale and all others interval variables.

Research Hypothesis: How the survey questionaire related to memory?

2.	Object-Spatial Imagery Questionnaire (OSIQ) The same participants of SAM data were now asked the Object-Spatial Imagery questions that consisted of two separate scales: an object imagery scale, with self-report items designed to assess object imagery preferences and experiences, and a spatial imagery scale, with self-report items designed to assess spatial imagery preferences and experiences. There were 14 Spatial Imagery questions & 16 Object Imagery questions that were rated on a scale of 1-5.

Research Hypothesis: How does OSIQ (Object-Spatial Imagery) survey relate to different types of memory (Episodic, Semantic, Spatial, Future) ?

3.	BIG 5 personality questionnaire: Same participants of SAM & OSIQ data were now asked questions related to personality traits. The survey consisted of question divided into 5 segments (Ex_: Extraversion questions, Ag_: Agreeable questions, Co_: Conscientiousness questions, Ne_: Neuroticism questions, Op_: Openness questions) all rated on scale of 1-5.

Research Hypothesis: How does memory (SAM & OSIQ) have an impact to personality traits (BFI) of an individual ?
